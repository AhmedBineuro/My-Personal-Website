                Hi there! I am <b>Ahmed Abdalla</b> (sometimes I also go by <i>Dynamic Bineuro</i>) and I am a passionate interdisciplinary programmer with experience ranging from games and graphics, to simulations and web applications.
                My main interests are game development, basketball and <i>(of course)</i> programming. I carry a diverse set of experiences from many different fields <i>(like human computer interaction and data analysis)</i> which
                allows me to quickly be able to learn and pick up new and different topics and concepts quickly. Not only that, but I genuinely do just enjoy learning about new things!
                Aside from software development, I have also gained experience 
                with embedded systems <i>(especially with the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/">ESP</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> platforms)</i> as well as visual design <i>(through tools like <a href="https://www.figma.com/sites/">Figma
                </a>,<a href="https://www.adobe.com/"> Adobe Illustrator</a>, and<a href="https://www.adobe.com/"> Adobe XD</a>)</i>. I also graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am looking for something to do so feel free to contact me!

                <b>P.S</b> <i>Dynamic Bineuro</i> came from a joke about having two very hard working  brain cells.
                <i> Dynamic</i> was for the activity and <i>Bineuro</i> was for the two brain cells (i.e two neurons).
